  - What how?<br>
    always tried have the project in a working with as little as know runtime issues<br>
  - Why<br>
     Working with C its really easy to get into memory issues and piles them up "i will fix them tomorrow"<br>
  - How long?
    I tracked my time with [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/)  the result was roughly 200hours that said there many more hour<br>
